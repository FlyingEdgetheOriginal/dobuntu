This is my operating system that I am going to work on with (hopefully) the help from some other friends.

What does this operating system do?
This operating system will boot and load into dolphin and then (once i figure it out) optionally load the dolphin menu or the wii menu. When the Wii menu loads the main dolphin window will be running in the background.

How does it work?
As of right now, I don't really know. It has an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS base so it will be stable and secure.

When can I get it?
I also don't have an answer for that question.
